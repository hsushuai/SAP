  # Game Manual
  Here are the core rules and mechanics you need to follow: 
  This is a 2-player grid-based game where all units occupy 1x1 tiles. Each player controls units and can create more by spending a single resource type, which acts as money. The grid position coordinates range from 0 to map width - 1 or map height - 1.
  
  Here is the game units description:
  - Resource: A non-player unit that provides resources.
  - Base: 10 HP, costs 10 resources, and takes 250 time units to build. Can produce Workers.
  - Barracks: 4 HP, costs 5 resources, and takes 200 time units to build. Can produce Light, Heavy, or Ranged units.
  - Worker: 1 HP, costs 1 resource, takes 50 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy](1 damage), and harvest mineral.
  - Light Unit: 4 HP, costs 2 resources, takes 80 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy] (2 damage).
  - Heavy Unit: 4 HP, costs 2 resources, takes 120 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy] (4 damage).
  - Ranged Unit: 1 HP, costs 2 resources, takes 100 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy] from 3 distance (1 damage, range 3).
  
  # Task Space
  Develop a winning task plan using allowed task space: 
  You are only allowed to utilize the specified tasks to devise your strategy. All tasks will only be assigned to one corresponding unit, so if you want multiple units to work together, please generate multiple repeated tasks.
  Each task comprises a task name (enclosed in square brackets, e.g. "[Harvest Mineral]") and task parameters (enclosed in parentheses, e.g. "(0, 0)"). 
  Your game plan should be a list of tasks, with "START OF TASK" and "END OF TASK" marking the beginning and end of the list, for example:
  START OF TASK
  [Harvest Mineral] (0, 0)
  [Produce Unit] (worker, 0)
  ...
  END OF TASK
  
  Here are the available tasks and their descriptions:
  - [Harvest Mineral] (x, y): Assign one worker to harvest resources from the mineral field located at (x, y). Note that this task is a continued task, which means that the worker will continue to harvest resources until mineral disappear or the game ends.
  - [Produce Unit] (unit_type, direction): Produce a unit of the specified type ("worker", "light", "heavy", or "ranged") in the specified direction ("north", "east", "south", or "west").
  - [Build Building] (building_type, (x, y), condition): Constructs a specified building type ("base" or "barracks") at coordinates (x, y) if the condition is met. The condition must be a resource-related expression, like resource >= 7, or set to False, indicating that construction will never occur.
  - [Deploy Unit] (unit_type, (x, y)): Deploy a unit of the specified type to the specified location (x, y). ONE location can ONLY have ONE unit deployed.
  - [Attack Enemy] (unit_type, enemy_type): Use a unit of a specified type ("worker", "light", "heavy", or "ranged") to attack an enemy unit of a specified type ("worker", "light", "heavy", "ranged", "base", or "barracks").

  Please note that your plans will be executed in order, so the one listed first will be executed first. You should strictly follow the parameter format and avoid outputting extra parameters.
  If you produce a unit type, be sure to assign a task to that unit type, otherwise they will block the entrance to the base or barracks, preventing the next unit from coming out.
  Please pay attention to the actual location of your current base. If you need to harvest resources, please go to the nearest mine location.

STRATEGY: |
  # Parameterized Strategy Space
  A strategy consists of several dimensions defined by specific parameters:
  
  1. **Economic Feature** focuses on how many workers to harvest in the game.
    - Parameter: Number of harvesting workers, corresponding to the number of [Harvest Mineral] tasks
    - Feature Space: {{1, 2}}
  2. **Barracks Feature** determines when to build barracks.  You can construct barracks when resources are greater than or equal to a specific threshold (N), or not build them at all (False).
    - Parameter: Timing of construction (resource quantity)
    - Feature Space: {{resource >= N, False}}, where 5 <= N <= 10
  3. **Military Feature** outlines the strategy for combining different unit types used for attack or defense, specifying which units to produce.
    - Parameter: Combination of unit types, including Worker, Heavy, Light, Ranged.
    - Feature Space: {{Worker, Ranged and Worker, Ranged and Light and Worker, ...}}
  4. **Aggression Feature** indicates whether the player's strategy is inclined toward aggressive play (attacking) or defensive play (holding ground).
  - Parameter: Aggression
  - Feature Space: {{True, False}}  # {{Aggressive, Defensive}}
  5. **Attack Feature** define the target priority during an attack if the Aggression Feature is set to True, focusing the military on attacking specific enemy unit types.
    - Parameter: Priority attack target
    - Feature Space: {{Building, Unit}}  # {{Attack Buildings (including Base and Barracks), Attack Units (including Workers, Heavy, Light, Ranged)}}
  6. **Defense Feature** specifies the defense range in terms of distance from the base on the x-axis, indicating where military units are deployed if the Aggressive feature is set to False.
    - Parameter: Distance from base on x-axis, i.e., defense range = {{(x_base ± dist, y)}}, where x_base is the x-coordinate of the base and 0 <= y <= map_height.
    - Feature Space: {{1, 2, 3, 4}}  # {{Close, Medium, Far, Very Far}}
  
  # Strategy
  The following is a detailed strategy you should strictly follow:

TIPS: |
  # Tips
  Here are some valuable suggestions that you should definitely consider:
  - If the Aggression Feature is set to True, DO NOT PLAN ANY [Deploy Unit] task, JUST focuses on  [Attack Enemy].
  - If the Aggression Feature is set to False, LAUNCH A COUNTERATTACK IN THE MID TO LATE (400-800 step times) GAME, AND DO NOT PLAN DEPLOY ANY MILITARY UNITS AFTER THAT.
  - The barracks should be located at the TOP or BOTTOM of the map to avoid enemy attacks.
  - Regarding the direction parameter of [Produce Unit], please be sure to follow the direction setting of the examples (alternating between east and south for player 0, or north and west for player 1)., otherwise it will cause the outlet to be blocked.
  - Prioritize collecting resources close to your base.
  - For [Attack Enemy] task, select the enemy_type to attack first according to your attack priority (attack feature).
  - If the Aggression Feature is set to True, plan MORE [Attack Enemy] tasks, DO NOT LESS THAN 20, enemy_type should includes all unit types.
  - If your Military Feature includes worker, plan MORE [Produce Unit] tasks to produce workers NOT LESS THAN 4, and use worker to attack enemy units.
  - You can optimize the expression for clarity and conciseness as follows:
  - Set the `loc` parameter of the [Deploy Unit] based on the defense strategy, where \( x = x_{{\text{{base}}}} \pm \text{{dist}} \), with `dist` determined by the defense feature, and \( y \) being any value in the range [0, map height-1]. Note that for player 0, \( x \) should use the '+' sign, while for player 1, it should use the '-' sign.
  - When enemy ONLY has 1 unit left, plan [Attack Enemy] task to attack it, DO NOT PLAN [Deploy Unit] task any more, no matter what strategy you use.
  - When enemy has 0 resource and only building left, plan [Attack Enemy] task to attack it, DO NOT PLAN [Deploy Unit] task any more, no matter what strategy you use.

  # Battlefield Situation
  Here is the description of the **current situation**: 
  {observation}

  You are now **player {player_id}**. Please create a task plan to win the game based on the current situation. If all enemy units (including bases, barracks, workers, heavy, light, and ranged) are destroyed, you will win the game.
  Keep in mind that your plan should be able to adapt to future situational changes, so it should include enough tasks (25 to 30 tasks are appropriate) to continue the subsequent time-step game.
  Output only the task plan in the specified format, without any extra content.
