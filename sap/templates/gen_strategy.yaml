  You are an RTS game master tasked with designing a robust and diverse strategy based on the provided parameterized framework.

  # Game Manual
  Here are the core rules and mechanics you need to follow: 
  This is a 2-player grid-based game where all units occupy 1x1 tiles. Each player controls units and can create more by spending a single resource type, which acts as money. The grid position coordinates range from 0 to map width - 1 or map height - 1.

  Here is the game units description:
  - Resource: A non-player unit that provides resources.
  - Base: 10 HP, costs 10 resources, and takes 250 time units to build. Can produce Workers.
  - Barracks: 4 HP, costs 5 resources, and takes 200 time units to build. Can produce Light, Heavy, or Ranged units.
  - Worker: 1 HP, costs 1 resource, takes 50 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy](1 damage), and harvest mineral.
  - Light Unit: 4 HP, costs 2 resources, takes 80 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy] (2 damage).
  - Heavy Unit: 4 HP, costs 2 resources, takes 120 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy] (4 damage).
  - Ranged Unit: 1 HP, costs 2 resources, takes 100 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy] from 3 distance (1 damage, range 3).

STRATEGY_SPACE: |
  # Parameterized Strategy
  A strategy consists of several dimensions defined by specific parameters:

  1. **Economic Feature** focuses on how many workers to harvest in the game.
    - Parameter: Number of harvesting workers
    - Feature Space: {{1, 2}}

  2. **Barracks Feature** determines when to build barracks.  You can construct barracks when resources are greater than or equal to a specific threshold (N), or not build them at all (False).
    - Parameter: Timing of construction (resource quantity)
    - Feature Space: {{resource >= N, False}}, where 5 <= N <= 10

  3. **Military Feature** outlines the strategy for combining different unit types used for attack or defense, specifying which units to produce.
    - Parameter: Combination of unit types, including Worker, Heavy, Light, Ranged.
    - Feature Space: {{Worker, Ranged and Worker, Ranged and Light and Worker, ...}}

  4. **Aggression Feature** indicates whether the player's strategy is inclined toward aggressive play (attacking) or defensive play (holding ground).
  - Parameter: Aggression
  - Feature Space: {{True, False}}  # {{Aggressive, Defensive}}

  5. **Attack Feature** define the target priority during an attack if the Aggressiveness Feature is set to True, focusing the military on attacking specific enemy unit types.
    - Parameter: Priority attack target
    - Feature Space: {{Building, Unit}}  # {{Attack Buildings, Attack Units (including Workers, Heavy, Light, Ranged)}}
  
  6. **Defense Feature** specifies the distance of the defense perimeter from the base, indicating where military units are deployed if the Aggressive feature is set to False.
    - Parameter: Distance from base
    - Feature Space: {{1, 2, 3, 4}}  # {{Close, Medium, Far, Very Far}}

  # Example
  Here is a parameterized strategy example for your reference. You have to output the same format as the example:
  (START OF EXAMPLE)
  ## Strategy
  - Economic Feature: 2
  - Barracks Feature: resource >= 7
  - Military Feature: Ranged and Worker
  - Aggression Feature: True
  - Attack Feature: Building
  - Defense Feature: None

  ## Description
  You should:
  - Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to support ongoing economic growth.
  - Construct barracks once resources exceed 7.
  - Keep producing your military (ranged and worker) more units is better.
  - Only produce ranged and worker units.
  - Prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units.
  - Send both workers and ranged units to attack, rather than just using a single type, cause you Military Feature is Ranged and Worker.
  - Omit designated defense areas, cause you Defense Feature is None.

  You should not:
  - Do not produce any other types of units except the specified type.
  - Do not plan deploy task, just go attacking.
  (END OF EXAMPLE)

  (START OF EXAMPLE)
  ## Strategy
  - Economic Feature: 1
  - Barracks Feature: False
  - Military Feature: Worker
  - Aggression Feature: False
  - Attack Feature: None
  - Defense Feature: 2

  ## Description
  You should:
  - Allocate one worker for mineral harvesting to sustain economic development.
  - Do not construct barracks, as the Barracks Feature is set to False.
  - Focus on producing only worker units.
  - Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense rather than attacking in the early stage (0~200 time steps).
  - Deploy your defense at a medium distance (distance = 2) from the base, allowing a perimeter of protection around your position.
  
  You should not:
  - Do not produce any unit types other than the specified worker units.
  - Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy leans towards defense in the early stage.
  - Avoid placing your defense too close or too far from the base, as the ideal perimeter is medium (distance = 2).

  # Existing Strategy
  There are already existing strategies as follows, which you should not repeated:
  {exist_strategy}

TIPS: |
  # Tips for Developing a Strategy:
  - Try single unit type military strategy.
  - Try barracks strategy without build barracks.
  - If your military strategy includes advanced unit types (ranged, heavy or light), your economic strategy can only be 2, that is, two workers mining together, because these military strategies are more expensive.
  - If your military strategy does not include any of the (ranged, heavy or light) options, your barracks strategy must be False, since you do not need to use the barracks produce them, so you do not need to build it.
  - Evaluate the coherence of the overall strategy composed of different features.
  - Do not output any irrelevant content.

  Now you are in the **player 0** side. Approach your task step by step.

OBS: |
  # Battlefield Situation
  Here is the description of the **current situation**: 
  {observation}

  You are now **player {player_id}**. Please create a counterstrategy to win the game based on the current situation. Output only the strategy in the specified format, without any extra content.

OBS_STRATEGY: |
  # Opponent Strategy
  Here is the description of the **Opponent Strategy**: 
  {0pponent}

  You are now **player {player_id}**. Please create a counterstrategy to win the game based on the current situation. Output only the strategy in the specified format, without any extra content.


FORMAT_INSTRUCTION: |
  You must generate a counterstrategy that includes all the features of a Parameterized Strategy. The strategy is wrapped in `<strategy></strategy>`, as shown below:
  <strategy>
  - Economic Feature: <VALUE>
  - Barracks Feature: <VALUE>
  - Military Feature: <VALUE>
  - Aggression Feature: <VALUE>
  - Attack Feature: <VALUE>
  - Defense Feature: <VALUE>
